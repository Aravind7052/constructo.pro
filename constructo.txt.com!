After agriculture, the construction industry is the second largest industry in India. The industry accounts for eight per cent of India's GDP as it is the largest direct and indirect creator of employment by hiring nearly 40 million people and creating more new jobs every year. 

The industry can be divided into three mega segments which are like the real estate sector — residential and commercial construction; infrastructure construction — includes roads, railways, airport, power, etc.; and industrial – which comprises refineries, textiles, pipelines, etc. The real estate construction plays a crucial role in making the industry booming and successful. But due to the prolonged slowdown in the real estate sector, the construction industry appears to be sluggish. The slowdown has also resulted in inventory overhang across India.
